The halfedge mesh class is equipped with a system of containers for associating data with mesh vertices, halfedges, edges, and faces. For instance, to represent a scalar value at vertices, or a vector value at faces, one can use 

```cpp
// on vertices
VertexData<double> myVertexScalar(mesh);
Vertex v = /* some vertex */;
myVertexScalar[v] = 42.;

// on faces
FaceData<Vector3> myFaceVector(mesh);
Face f = /* some face */;
myFaceVector[f] = Vector3{1., 2., 3.};
```
and so on.


A key feature of the `MeshData<>` containers is that they **automatically adapt to mutation of the underlying mesh**. All existing `MeshData<>` containers will remain valid during any sequence of mesh element insertions and deletions, adaptively and efficiently resizing themselves as needed. These containers can also be [automatically written to file](io.md#serializing-containers).


## Mesh data types

The mesh data types are all templated on a common base class: `MeshData<E,T>`, where `E` is an element pointer type (such as `Vertex`) and `T` is a scalar type (such as `double`). The first template argument should usually be omitted in user code; the various element containers are all typedef'd with concise names as follows:

- `VertexData<T>` data at vertices
- `HalfedgeData<T>` data at (interior and exterior) halfedges 
- `CornerData<T>` data at corners
- `EdgeData<T>` data at edges 
- `FaceData<T>` data at faces 
- `BoundaryLoopData<T>` data at boundary loops

Most functionality is identical between all of these classes, so the sections below are written in terms of the generic `MeshData<>` class.

## Construction


??? func "`#!cpp MeshData<E,T>::MeshData<E,T>(HalfedgeMesh& mesh)`"
    Construct a new container over a mesh. Elements will be default-initialized with `T()`.

??? func "`#!cpp MeshData<E,T>::MeshData<E,T>(HalfedgeMesh& mesh, T initVal)`"
    Construct a new container over a mesh. 
    
    Elements will be initialized with `initVal`, and any newly-created mesh elements will have their default values set to `initVal`.

Additionally, see the vector-based initializers in [vector interoperability](containers.md#vector-interoperability).


## Accessors

??? func "`#!cpp T& MeshData<E,T>::operator[](E ptr)`"

    Access data stored in the container with a reference to a mesh element. A const version also exists; expect semantics like `std::vector<>`.

    For example:
    ```cpp
    // on vertices
    VertexData<double> myVertexScalar(mesh);
    Vertex v = /* some vertex */;
    myVertexScalar[v] = 42.;
    double val = myVertexScalar[v];
    ```

??? func "`#!cpp T& MeshData<E,T>::operator[](size_t ind)`"

    Access data stored in the container by the index of a mesh element. A const version also exists; expect semantics like `std::vector<>`.

    Only valid when the underlying mesh is [compressed](mutation.md#compressed-mode).
    
    Must have `0 <= ind < N`, where `N` is the number of elements of that type.

    For example:
    ```cpp
    // on vertices
    VertexData<double> myVertexScalar(mesh);
    myVertexScalar[11] = 42.;
    double val = myVertexScalar[11];

    // equivalent to:
    double val = myVertexScalar[mesh->vertex(11)];

    ```
    

??? func "`#!cpp void MeshData<E,T>::fill(T fillVal)`"

    Fill all entries in the container with `fillVal`.

??? func "`#!cpp size_t MeshData<E,T>::size()`"

    The size of the container (equal to the number of elements of type `E`, e.g. `HalfedgeMesh::nVertices()`).


## Vector interoperability

To support easy common-case linear algebra operations, `MeshData<>` containers support conversion to and from Eigen vector types.

The corresponding vectors are indexed according to the indices of the underlying mesh elements, or by a user-supplied index map which maps each elements to a dense set of zero-based indices.


**Construct from a vector:**

??? func "`#!cpp MeshData<E,T>::MeshData<E,T>(HalfedgeMesh& mesh Eigen::Matrix<T, Eigen::Dynamic, 1> vec)`"

    Construct a new container over a mesh, with the contents of `vec`.
  

??? func "`#!cpp MeshData<E,T>::MeshData<E,T>(HalfedgeMesh& mesh Eigen::Matrix<T, Eigen::Dynamic, 1> vec, MeshData<E, size_t>& indexer)`"

    Construct a new container over a mesh, with the contents of `vec`, indexed according to `indexer`.


**Fill from a vector:**

??? func "`#!cpp void MeshData<E,T>::fromVector(Eigen::Matrix<T, Eigen::Dynamic, 1> vec)`"

    Fill this container with the contents of `vec`.
    

??? func "`#!cpp void MeshData<E,T>::fromVector(Eigen::Matrix<T, Eigen::Dynamic, 1> vec, MeshData<E, size_t>& indexer)`"

    Fill this container with the contents of `vec`, indexed according to `indexer`.


**Convert to a vector:**

??? func "`#!cpp Eigen::Matrix<T, Eigen::Dynamic, 1> MeshData<E,T>::toVector()`"

    Return a new vector which holds the contents of this container.
    

??? func "`#!cpp Eigen::Matrix<T, Eigen::Dynamic, 1> MeshData<E,T>::toVector(MeshData<E, size_t>& indexer)`"

    Return a new vector which holds the contents of this container, indexed according to `indexer`.
    

    


## Transferring data

`MeshData<>` containers are defined with respect to a particular mesh object. Sometimes one may need to transfer data defined on one mesh to another, for instance after making a copy of a mesh, or when reading data from file.

??? func "`#!cpp MeshData<E,T> MeshData<E,T>::reinterpretTo(HalfedgeMesh& target)`"

    Map data defined on one halfedge mesh to another. The meshes must have the same number of elements, and data will be naively transferred between elements with the same index.

    Requires that both meshes be [compressed](mutation.md#compressed-mode).

    Example usage:
    ```cpp
    HalfedgeMesh meshA = /* something */;
    HalfedgeMesh meshB = meshA.copy();

    FaceData<Vector3> myDataOnA(meshA);
    /* fill myDataOnA with interesting values */

    FaceData<Vector3> myDataOnB = myDataOnA.reinterpretTo(meshB);
    ```


## Advanced features

### Underlying storage

Under the hood, all `MeshData<>` types use a `std::vector<T>` to store their values. This has at least two significant consquences:

- For the scalar type `bool`, these containers are essentially broken, [because `std::vector<bool>` is a weird, broken special case](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17794569/why-is-vectorbool-not-a-stl-container). Using `char` instead is usually a fine substitute: you can construct `VertexData<char> flags` and set `flags[vert] = true` as you would expect.

- A special allocator is needed for aligned objects, in particular fixed-size Eigen types (see [gotchas](/numerical/matrix_types#gotchas)). These `MeshData<>` containers all internally use the aligned allocator `std::vector<T, Eigen::aligned_allocator<T>>`, so **they can safely store fixed-sized Eigen types**.

### Oriented edge data 

<!--TODO reword...-->
Scalar values on edges often carry meaning with respect to some oriented direction along the edge--- common examples include differences between values at vertices, the integral of a vector field along an edge, or more generally any 1-form in discrete differential geometry. In such settings, a scalar value is concisely stored along edges, but its sign should flip when accessed "along" the opposite direction.

`EdgeData<T>` containers offer a pair of special additional accessors for oriented data, which handle the sign flips automatically. Note that they cannot be instantiated unless the scalar type `T` supports a unary `-` operator.

??? func "`#!cpp T EdgeData<T>::getOriented(Halfedge he)`"

    Access edge-valued data with sign determined by canonical halfedge orientation.

    Returns `edgeData[he.edge()]` if `he == he.edge().halfedge()`, or `-edgeData[he.edge()]` otherwise.


??? func "`#!cpp void EdgeData<T>::setOriented(Halfedge he, T val)`"
    
    Access edge-valued data with sign determined by canonical halfedge orientation.

    Sets `edgeData[he.edge()] = val` if `he == he.edge().halfedge()`, or `edgeData[he.edge()] = -val` otherwise.
